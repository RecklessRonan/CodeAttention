## Introduction

We proposed a metric-based probing method, namely, CAT-probing, to quantitatively evaluate how CodePTMs Attention scores relate to distances between AST nodes.

More details are provided in our EMNLP'22 paper and [our paper](https://preview.aclanthology.org/emnlp-22-ingestion/2022.findings-emnlp.295/).

## Environment & Preparing

```bash
conda create --name cat python=3.7
conda activate cat
pip install -r requirements.txt
git clone https://github.com/nchen909/CodeAttention
cd CodeAttention/evaluator/CodeBLEU/parser
bash build.sh
cd ../../../
cp evaluator/CodeBLEU/parser/my-languages.so build/
#make sure git-lfs installed like 'apt-get install git-lfs'
apt-get install git-lfs
bash get_models.sh
```

### Preparing data

The dataset we use comes from [CodeSearchNet](https://github.com/microsoft/CodeXGLUE/tree/main/Code-Text/code-to-text) .

```shell
mkdir data
cd data
pip install gdown
gdown https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1t8GncfPknpumOKbgUXux-EkuYnOZ6EfW
unzip data.zip
rm data.zip
```

### Preparing local path

Direct WORKDIR in run.sh and run_att.sh to your path.

## Using CAT-probing

### Finetune

```bash
export MODEL_NAME=
export TASK="summarize"
export SUB_TASK=
bash run.sh $MODEL_NAME $TASK $SUB_TASK
```

  `MODEL_NAME` can be any one of `["roberta", "codebert", "graphcodebert", "unixcoder"]`.

  `SUB_TASK` can be any one of `["go", "java", "javascript", "python"]`.

### Probing

```bash
# first modify WORKDIR in run_att.sh to yours 
export MODEL_NAME=
export TASK="summarize"
export SUB_TASK=
export LAYER_NUM=
bash run_att.sh $MODEL_NAME $TASK $SUB_TASK $LAYER_NUM
```

`MODEL_NAME` can be any one of `["roberta", "codebert", "graphcodebert", "unixcoder"]`.

`SUB_TASK` can be any one of `["go", "java", "javascript", "python"]`.

`LAYER_NUM` can be any one of `[0-11]` or `-1` (`11` refers to the last layer,  `-1` refers to all `[0-11]` layers).

## Visualization

Visualization results can be found in `att-vis-notebook` folder.
