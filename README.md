## Updates

- 2022/10/06: Release the paper of CAT-probing, check out our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04633). 👏
- 2022/10/06: CAT-probing is accepted by **Findings of EMNLP 2022** 🎉

## Introduction

**TBD**

More details are provided in our EMNLP22 paper and our arXiv paper [CAT-probing: A Metric-based Approach to Interpret How Pre-trained Models for Programming Language Attend Code Structure](CAT-probing: A Metric-based Approach to Interpret How Pre-trained Models for Programming Language Attend Code Structure).

## Environment

```bash
conda create --name cat python=3.7
conda activate cat
pip install -r requirements.txt
git clone https://github.com/nchen909/CodeAttention
cd CodeAttention
```

## Using CAT-probing

### Preparing Data

The dataset we use comes from [CodeSearchNet](https://github.com/microsoft/CodeXGLUE/tree/main/Code-Text/code-to-text) and you can download from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1acPGFpw8uJMCdAj7iXkd-_Vq0LjNkaW3?usp=sharing), and add data to ./data.

## Train

```bash
# first modify WORKDIR in run.sh to yours 
export MODEL_NAME=
export TASK="summarize"
export SUB_TASK=
bash run.sh $MODEL_NAME $TASK $SUB_TASK
```

  `MODEL_NAME` can be any one of `["roberta", "codebert", "graphcodebert", "unixcoder"]`.

  `SUB_TASK` can be any one of `["go", "java", "javascript", "python"]`.

## Probing

```bash
# first modify WORKDIR in run_att.sh to yours 
export MODEL_NAME=
export TASK="summarize"
export SUB_TASK=
export LAYER_NUM=
bash run_att.sh $MODEL_NAME $TASK $SUB_TASK $LAYER_NUM
```

`MODEL_NAME` can be any one of `["roberta", "codebert", "graphcodebert", "unixcoder"]`.

`SUB_TASK` can be any one of `["go", "java", "javascript", "python"]`.

`LAYER_NUM` can be any one of `[0-11]` or `-1` (`11` refers to the last layer,  `-1` refers to all `[0-11]` layers).

## Visualization

Visualization results can be found in `att-vis-notebook` folder.
